description = "Génère les tests unitaires pour une classe Java."
prompt = """
You are an expert Java developer specializing in testing. Your task is to generate a complete set of unit tests for a given Java class.

**Context:**
- The project is a Spring Boot application.
- The source code for the class is located in the src/main/java directory.
- Tests should be placed in the src/test/java directory, following the same package structure.
- The project uses JUnit 5 and Mockito for testing.

**Instructions:**
1.  Receive a fully qualified class name as an argument (e.g., com.example.petmanagement.service.CatService).
2.  Locate the class file in the src/main/java directory.
3.  Analyze the public methods of the class.
4.  Generate a new JUnit 5 test class in the corresponding src/test/java directory.
5.  The test class should be named <ClassName>Test.java.
6.  For each public method, create one or more test methods that cover its functionality.
7.  Use Mockito to mock any dependencies.
8.  The generated tests should be robust, covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.
9.  Do not generate tests for constructors, getters, or setters unless they contain complex logic.
10. The output should be only the Java code for the test class.

The fully qualified name of the class to be tested is: {{1}}
